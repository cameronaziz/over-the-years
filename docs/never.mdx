## What is `never`?
In typescript, there is a type of `never`, representing a value that should never occur. This can be used as a return type of a function that will always throw - or possibly throw.
```typescript
const reportError = (errorMessage: string) => {
	throw new Error(errorMessage)
}
```
This function will never return and has the type signature of:
```typescript
const reportMe: (errorMessage: string) => never
```

Another often appearance of `never` is the return type of a function that never resolves
```typescript
const exitProgram = () => {
	process.exit()
}
```
This also will also never return, as the process will never return control back to the callee, and thus has the type signature of:
```typescript
const exitProgram: () => never
```
### Binary Relations
`never` is a subtype of anything, yet nothting is a subtype of `never`, except `never` itselt.
```
never <: any
any >: never
never <: never
```
### Simply Put...
The common use case of the  `never`  type, that isn't Typescript just yelling at you, is the return type of a function that doesn't return.

## Then why are we talking?
When the Typescript compiler *does* yell at you. This often pops up when attempting to assign a value to something that should never (pun intended) be assigned.

Common occurrences of this are inside inaccessible blocks and untyped initiators.

### Inaccessible Blocks
#### Problem
```typescript
if (typeof data === 'string' && typeof data === 'number') {
	const dataString = data.toString()
}
```
Fairly simple, within the `if` block, the variable `data` is of type `never` because both `typeof data === 'string'` AND `typeof data === 'number'` cannot be true.
This code can never be reached, so the Typescript compiler is simply saying 'this variable will never be anything because we can't get here'.

### Untyped Initiators
#### Problem
```typescript
// Lets make a list that we will add the first five classmates found.
const firstFiveClassmates = []

// Loop over the people
for (const person of people) {
	// If they are a classmate, push the person to the array
	if (person.isClassmate) {
		firstFiveClassmates.push(person)
	}

	// With a for loop, we can break out!
	if (firstFiveClassmates.length === 5) {
		continue
	}

}
```
And then Typescript throws an error, on this line:
```typescript
firstFiveClassmates.push(person)

// Error, assuming `people` is of type `Person`
Argument of type 'Person' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
```
#### Solution
All the way back at the beginning, we defined `firstFiveClassmates` as an empty array, but we never told Typescript compiler it will be *an array of what*. One part of the code could be adding a `Person` to the array, and another could be adding a `Llama` - because who doesn't want to have a llama in their class?

Although the Typescript compiler doesn't give us much help, its an easy fix! When instantiating the array, we just define what the array elements will be.

```typescript
const firstFiveClassmates: Array<Person | Llama> = [] // Because llamas are always allowed, duh.
```
